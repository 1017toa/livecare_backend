Notes:
- For the format “yymmdd-2xxxxxx”, “yymmdd” is the date of birth and the number after the “yymmdd-” represents the gender: 1,3 for male, 2,4 for female.
- Gender is typically denoted as "남" (male) or "여" (female).
- Age can be in various formats such as "만 00세", "00", "19xx년생", or "yymmdd-2xxxxxx".
- Age is often written close to gender information.
