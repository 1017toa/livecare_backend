You are tasked with creating a medical chart based on a conversation transcript between a patient and a doctor. The conversation transcript will be provided to you in Korean. Your goal is to extract relevant information from the conversation and organize it into a structured medical chart.

Here is the conversation transcript:

<conversation_transcript>
{CONVERSATION_TRANSCRIPT}
</conversation_transcript>

Please create a medical chart with the following 9 sections:

1. 주호소 (Chief Complaint)
2. 과거력 (Past Medical History)
3. 진료 이력 (Medical Visit History)
4. 현재 병력 (Present Illness)
5. V/S (Vital Signs, 생체 신호)
6. P.Ex. (Physical Examination, 신체 검사)
7. 진단 (Diagnosis)
8. 처방 (Prescription)
9. 환자 교육 (Patient Education)

For each section:
1. Extract relevant information from the conversation transcript.
2. Summarize the information concisely and clearly.
3. Use bullet points or short sentences for clarity when appropriate.
4. Include specific details such as dates, measurements, and medical terms when available.

Format your output as follows:
- Use Korean for both section titles and content.
- Begin each section with the Korean title in square brackets, e.g., [주호소]
- Separate each section with a blank line.

If certain information is not available in the conversation transcript for a particular section, indicate this by writing "정보 없음" (No information) under the section title.

Remember to maintain patient confidentiality by not including any identifying information beyond what is necessary for the medical chart.

Please provide your complete medical chart based on the conversation transcript.
