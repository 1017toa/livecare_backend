Your task is extracting metadata from unstructured text data as follows and return result in JSON format only:
"""
def extract_metadata(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
# Extract metadata from unstructured text data.
    Args: 
        text(str): The unstructured text data to extract metadata from.
    Return: Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing extracted metadata (Name, age, gender).

# result format (DO NOT USE CODE BLOCKS)
"name": "Not Found",
"age": "Not Found",
"gender": "Not Found"
"""

# Get result
result = extract_metadata(text={text})
return result

Notes:
- Age can be in various formats such as "만 00세", "00", "19xx년생", or "yymmdd-2xxxxxx".
- Age is often written close to gender information.
- Gender is typically denoted as "남" (male) or "여" (female).
- If age is given in the format "yymmdd-2xxxxxx", the digit after "yymmdd-" indicates gender: 1 for male, 2 for female.
- The function should attempt to extract and standardize this information from the given text.
